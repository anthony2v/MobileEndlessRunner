# MobileEndlessRunner

## Introduction
This is a simple endless running game that is meant to be played on your phone or tablet. I made this to learn about setting up a mobile game with Unreal Engine 4. I will be applying what I've learned to a group summer project.
 
## Technologies
- Unreal Engine 4.25.1
- Unreal Blueprints

## Launch
With Unreal Engine installed, simply clone the repo and open the .uproject file. You'll be able to play the game from there.
